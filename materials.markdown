# Materials
There are a few applications and peripherals that are required to use this program. This includes a keyboard and an IDE/compiler (or an alternative method for compiling .cpp files)

## Keyboard

A keyboard is required in order to play the game. While any keyboard with numbers 1-9 will work, the program was designed with a [numberpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_keypad) in mind. More on this in the `How to Play` section,

## Compiler

In order to run the program, you will need to download and install a IDE/compiler for C++. It is possible to compile C++ code without one, but that is only recommended for advanced users. There are many compilers available for free but my personal choice is [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads).
