# Introduction

This documentation will give you a comprehensive overview of my Tic-Tac-Toe game. This game is written in [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and is played in the [console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Console). As such, access to a keyboard is required. More details about materials and programs needed can be found in the `Materials` section.
