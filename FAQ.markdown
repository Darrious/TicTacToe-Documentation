# FAQ
---

## Do I need an IDE/compiler to run this?

No, you do not need a compiler. The folder comes with an `.exe` file. If you would look to compile the code yourself or play around with it then I would recommend [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads).

## Where can I find the source code?

You can find the source code for this project at
[GitHub](https://github.com/Darrious/TicTacToe).
