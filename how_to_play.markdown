## Compiling the Program <a name="compile"></a>

1. Run your compiler of choice and open `TicTacToe.cpp` The project may include other C++ classes and files but this is the only file you need to compile.

2. If you are using a plain text editor instead of an IDE, follow [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/walkthrough-compiling-a-native-cpp-program-on-the-command-line?view=vs-2019) for compilation instructions. If you are using an IDE, find and click the compile and run button. This will vary from IDE to IDE but it is usually denoted by a green arrow.

## Menu Options <a name="menu_options"></a>
Once `TicTacToe.cpp` is compiled and ran, you should see a text prompt in the console. The menu has an option to play against another player or to play against the AI. Press 1 on the keyboard and hit enter to select AI or press 2 on the keyboard and hit enter to select two players. This will start the game. Type 99 and hit enter at any time during the game to quit the game. Type 1 and hit enter at the end of a match to play again.

## Playing <a name="playing"></a>
The game will alternate turns after every move starting with player 1. The game is controlled using the numberpad on the right side of your keyboard. Each number corrosponds with a square on the board as pictured below.

Pressing 3 on the number pad corresponds with the bottom right square of the tic-tac-toe board while 5 corresponds with the middle square of the board.
